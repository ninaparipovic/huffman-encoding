This project uses the Huffman encoding method to compress and decompress a normal text file. Implements hash maps to calculate words and frequencies, as well as a priority queue to ordering frequencies and subsequently form a binary tree with each leaf node representing a letter and its frequency. The number in each internal node gives the frequency of its subtree. An example of a Huffmann Tree:
